# GitHub Contribution Report

A production-quality, async Python tool that exports **every commit, pull
request, repository contribution and organization contribution** accessible to
one or more GitHub Personal Access Tokens into clean **CSV**, **Excel**,
**HTML/Markdown reports** and **charts**.

Works for **any GitHub account** — just pass `--user <login>` and set the
matching token once.

---

## Quick Start (your own account)

> **5 minutes to your first report.**

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_FORK/CommitsTracker.git
cd CommitsTracker
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create a GitHub token

Go to **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)**.

Create a classic token with these scopes:

| Scope | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `repo` | Read your own private repos AND private repos you collaborate on |
| `read:org` | Read organization membership and org repos |

> **Fine-grained tokens will miss private/work commits.** See [Capturing private commits](#capturing-private--organization--work-commits) below.

### 3. Set your token

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# Windows PowerShell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_your_token_here"
```

Or copy the example and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # macOS/Linux
Copy-Item .env.example .env   # Windows PowerShell
```

Then edit `.env`:

```dotenv
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

### 4. Run

```bash
python github_report.py --user YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN
```

Open `output/report.html` in your browser — done.

## Features

| Area | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Authentication** | One Personal Access Token per account, read from `GITHUB_TOKEN_<LOGIN>` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (optionally via a `.env` file). |
| **Repository discovery** | Personal, private, organization and collaborator repos — paginated and de-duplicated. |
| **Commits** | Every commit authored by the tracked users, with repo, org, SHA, message, dates, author name/email, branch and URL. Scans all branches by default. |
| **Pull requests** | Open / closed / merged PRs with repo, title, created/merged dates, state and URL. |
| **Organizations** | Org membership plus per-org contribution counts (commits, PRs, merged PRs, repos contributed to). |
| **Statistics** | Commits per repo / year / month, by author email, by organization; PR & merged-PR counts; top repositories. |
| **Readable reports** | A self-contained **styled HTML report** (`report.html`, charts embedded — open/share in any browser) and a structured **Markdown report** (`report.md`). |
| **Work narrative** | Per-repo "what was worked on", derived deterministically from **PR titles, humanised branch names and recurring commit keywords** — no AI/API key needed. |
| **Activity insights** | Active days, longest daily streak, busiest day-of-week & month, average commits per active week, and primary languages. |
| **Any user** | Works for any GitHub login via `--user <login>`. |
| **Outputs** | 5 CSV files + a 13-sheet formatted Excel workbook + HTML & Markdown reports. |
| **Charts** | Per-year, per-month, day-of-week, top-repository and per-org bar charts, plus a combined dashboard PNG. |
| **Branches** | Scans **every branch by default** (complete coverage); `--default-branch-only` for a faster run. |
| **Performance** | Async (`aiohttp`) requests with a shared concurrency limiter, GitHub rate-limit handling (primary + secondary), exponential-backoff retries and progress bars. |
| **Quality** | Python 3.12+, full type hints, structured logging, modular architecture, defensive error handling, offline test suite. |

## Setup

### Token environment variables

The tool resolves each user's token in this order (first match wins):

| Priority | Variable name | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | An explicit mapping in `config.py` → `DEFAULT_USER_TOKEN_ENV` | — |
| 2 | `GITHUB_TOKEN_<LOGIN>` (login upper-cased, `-`/`.` → `_`) | `GITHUB_TOKEN_ALICE` for login `alice` |
| 3 | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | single-user fallback |

**Examples for multiple accounts:**

```dotenv
# in .env
GITHUB_TOKEN_ALICE=ghp_aaaa   # python github_report.py --user alice
GITHUB_TOKEN_BOB=ghp_bbbb     # python github_report.py --user bob
```

```bash
python github_report.py --user alice --user bob
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Single account
python github_report.py --user YOUR_LOGIN

# Multiple accounts
python github_report.py --user alice --user bob

# All-branches (this is the DEFAULT — complete coverage)
python github_report.py --user YOUR_LOGIN

# Faster run: default branch only
python github_report.py --user YOUR_LOGIN --default-branch-only

# Force-include repos/orgs that auto-discovery might miss
python github_report.py --user YOUR_LOGIN \
    --org your-company \
    --repo colleague/private-project
```

> **Branch coverage:** every branch is scanned **by default** so nothing is
> missed. Use `--default-branch-only` for a quick run that covers just the
> default branch of each repo (5-10× faster on large accounts).

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--user LOGIN` | Restrict to one user (repeatable). Required — no built-in defaults. | — |
| `--all` | All users listed in `DEFAULT_USER_TOKEN_ENV` (empty unless you add entries). | — |
| `--output DIR` | Output directory. | `output` |
| `--concurrency N` | Max concurrent API requests. | `8` |
| `--repo OWNER/NAME` | Force-include a specific repo (repeatable). Also reads `EXTRA_REPOS`. | — |
| `--org ORG` | Force-include every accessible repo in an org (repeatable). Also reads `EXTRA_ORGS`. | — |
| `--no-search-discovery` | Disable commit-search-based repo discovery. | on |
| `--no-org-repos` | Don't enumerate every repo inside your orgs. | enumerate |
| `--all-branches` | Scan every branch (this is the default; flag kept for explicitness). | **on** |
| `--default-branch-only` | Faster: scan only each repo's default branch. | off |
| `--skip-forks` | Don't scan commits/PRs in forks. | off |
| `--no-prs` | Skip pull request collection. | off |
| `--no-commits` | Skip commit collection. | off |
| `--no-charts` | Skip chart/dashboard generation. | off |
| `--max-repos N` | Limit repositories scanned (testing). | unlimited |
| `--log-level LEVEL` | `DEBUG`/`INFO`/`WARNING`/`ERROR`. | `INFO` |
| `--version` | Print version and exit. | — |

---

## Configuring default users (optional)

If you regularly run reports for the same logins, you can add them as
defaults so you don't have to type `--user` every time.

Edit `github_contrib/config.py` and add your logins to `DEFAULT_USER_TOKEN_ENV`:

```python
DEFAULT_USER_TOKEN_ENV: dict[str, str] = {
    "alice": "GITHUB_TOKEN_ALICE",
    "bob":   "GITHUB_TOKEN_BOB",
}
```

After that, `python github_report.py --all` runs for both without extra flags.

---

## How it works

1. **Authenticate & discover** — each token calls `GET /user` (validation) then
   `GET /user/repos?affiliation=owner,collaborator,organization_member&visibility=all`
   to enumerate every accessible repo, plus `GET /user/orgs` for membership.
   Repos seen by multiple tokens are merged (union of "who can reach it" is kept).
2. **Collect commits** — for every repo, `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?author={login}`
   for each tracked login. De-duplicated by SHA per repo.
3. **Collect pull requests** — `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=all`, filtered
   to PRs opened by the tracked logins. `merged` is derived from `merged_at`.
4. **Aggregate organizations** — contribution counts are rolled up per org.
5. **Compute statistics** with pandas and **export** to CSV, Excel and charts.

### Rate limits & performance

* The authenticated REST API allows **5,000 requests/hour**. A shared
  `asyncio.Semaphore` bounds concurrency (`--concurrency`, default 8).
* When `X-RateLimit-Remaining` hits 0, or a `Retry-After` header is returned,
  the client sleeps until the reset time and resumes automatically.
* Transient errors (timeouts, 5xx) are retried with exponential backoff.

## Capturing private / organization / work commits

If commits you made in **private or work repositories are missing**, it is
almost always the **token type**, not the tool.  Work through this checklist:

1. **Use a classic token with `repo` + `read:org`.** Fine-grained tokens cannot
   read repos owned by other users/orgs. The tool warns you at startup if it
   detects this.

   | You want to capture… | Classic `ghp_…` (`repo`,`read:org`) | Fine-grained `github_pat_…` |
   | --- | :---: | :---: |
   | Your own public repos | ✅ | ✅ |
   | Your own private repos | ✅ | only if granted |
   | **Private repos of *other* users you collaborate on** | ✅ | ❌ |
   | **Private organization / work repos** | ✅ | only if token is scoped to that org |
   | Org membership | ✅ | ❌ unless granted |

2. **Let discovery do its work.** With a proper token the tool finds repos
   four ways:
   * `GET /user/repos` (owner + collaborator + organization_member),
   * every repo inside each org you belong to (`--no-org-repos` to skip),
   * repos surfaced by the **commit Search API** (`--no-search-discovery` to skip),
   * anything you force-include below.

3. **Force-include known repos/orgs** the discovery still misses:
   ```bash
   python github_report.py --user YOUR_LOGIN \
       --org acme-corp \
       --repo colleague/their-private-repo \
       --repo acme-corp/work-backend
   ```
   or set `EXTRA_REPOS` / `EXTRA_ORGS` in `.env`.

---

## Testing

Offline tests (no network, no tokens) validate parsing, statistics, exporters,
charts and the async pagination/rate-limit logic:

```bash
python tests/test_offline.py
# or, if pytest is installed:
pytest -q
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `No users specified` | Add `--user YOUR_LOGIN` to the command. |
| `Configuration error: Missing GitHub token(s)` | Set `GITHUB_TOKEN_<LOGIN>` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (env or `.env`). |
| `Authentication failed (401)` | Token is invalid/expired or lacks scopes. Recreate it. |
| Repeated "Rate limit reached; sleeping…" | Normal for large accounts; lower `--concurrency` or wait. |
| Private/org repos missing | Token lacks `repo` / `read:org` (classic) or the equivalent fine-grained permissions. |
| `403` for specific repos | The token's account cannot access that repo; it is skipped. |
